# A project I'm working on using HTML, CSS and TypeScript.

Based on https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html

to run the project, copy the contents of ./dist in and open index.html.

## Some tools I'm using because they just make things better:

- TypeScript because its JavaScript but better
- SASS for nesting selectors with .scss files
  - I haven't learned how to use mixins and all the other stuff yet, so i'm basically still writing CSS except with nesting.
- Vite
  - so i can do 'import thisModule.ts' and not have to worry about whether i typed .js or .ts
  - same thing with .scss files
  - that's about it. Vite can probably do more but ðŸ¤·

### Things to do

- do up the other types of sorts

### Things i _might_ do, in order of likelihood:

1. maybe start using bulma for styling instead of whatever this is now.
2. better animation
3. look at what i can do with SASS/SCSS
4. look at haml? it looks like html but better

I'm also making my way through [Secrets of the Javascript Ninja](https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja-second-edition), so i'll probably be trying to put concepts i pick up there into use too.
